# ravenan-backend

<!-- Start the backend server using nodemon for automatic restarts on code changes.  -->
<!-- Run the command: nodemon index.js -->

<!-- The server runs on SERVERPORT: 3001 by default, and this can be modified in App\Configuration\Environment.js. -->

<!-- Database connection details (DATABASEHOST, DBUSERNAME, DBPASSWORD, DATABASENAME, DATABASEPORT) are defined in App\Configuration\Environment.js and should be updated to match your local or production setup. -->

<!-- The backend uses JWT_SECRET_KEY for authentication, which is stored in App\Configuration\Environment.js. Ensure this key is secure and unique. -->

<!-- Verify that all environment variables in Environment.js are properly set before running the backend to avoid configuration errors. -->
